To build using Xcode 10:

• Open Meteorologist.xcodeproj
• Select the project then click on the General tab. Change the Team dropdown to your Apple Dev account.
• Make sure code signing is: Authority=Developer ID… (not Authority=Mac Developer).
• • Do this for both Project and Target
• Test away.
• Make sure the VERSION2 file is updated (do not end with CRLF).
• Make sure the CHANGELOG2 file is updated.
• Make sure the version (Bundle versions string, short) in info.plist is updated.
• Make sure README.txt is updated.
• Use SVN to update the project (see below).


• Starting with macOS 10.15, notorization is required.
• To start this process, you will need an App Specific password. I labeled mine Meteorologist. See https://ioshacker.com/how-to/generate-app-specific-passwords-apple-id-guide
• For the Meteo build, you will need to create two specific files in your home folder: 1) ./altoolid and ./altoolpw
• ./altoolid will contain your Apple developer ID (email address).
• ./altoolpw will contain your App Specific password.
• Now run build_dmg.sh (in the trunk folder). This will create Meteorologist-v.r.m.dmg in the build folder using all the pieces above.

• Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/heat-meteo/ and navigate to Files.
• Create a new folder under Meteo called Meteo v.r.m.
• Upload the Meteorologist-v.r.m.dmg file (from the build directory).
• Upload the README.txt (from the base directory) file.
• Select the Info button for Meteorologist-v.r.m.dmg file and mark it as the default download for Platform: Mac (OS X)


• Open sftp <yourid>,heat-meteo@web.sourceforge.net (/home/project-web/heat-meteo/htdocs)
• From the ../Website folder ———
• Update version.xml
• Update faq.html
• Update index.html
	For index.html, create a new section at the top of the main page describing the changes. In the detail second below, create an entirely new “fix” section, describe the change again, and update the link to point to the new version. If you highlight and duplicate the previous “fix”, you can do a CHANGE ALL in the selected section to pick up all changes. Finally, update the “Download latest version” section in the upper right of the page (near the top of the HTML).
    Update faq.html (upper left corner)

• From the ./trunk folder ———
• Update CHANGELOG2
• Update VERSION2


Quit and restart your copy of Meteo to make sure everything is looking OK.
