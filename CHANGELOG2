3.0.1

* Fix launch failure on 10.9 systems
* Add French localizations (any other volunteers?)
* Add "Loading..." during the startup delay
* Change default weather source back to Yahoo! (no API key necessary for now).

3.0.0

* STOP!!! - Don't update without reading and understanding the 3.x update. Also recommend that you keep the prior version and turn off version checks if you aren't 100% comfortable with this version.

* Rather than trying to be all things for everybody for all weather stations for all locations, Meteo is now geared to be specific the particular weather service selected.
*   Each user will needs an API key for each weather source so the usage for one person doesn't infringe on another.
*   And much moreâ€¦
