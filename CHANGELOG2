3.0.0
*
* STOP!!! - Don't update without reading and understanding this upgrade. Also recommend that you keep the prior version and turn off version checks if you aren't comfortable with this change.
*
* Rather than trying to be all things for everybody for all weather stations for all locations, Meteo is now geared to be specific the particular weather service selected.
*   Each user will needs an API key for each weather source so the usage for one person doesn't infringe on another.
*   Also the Input City Name is specific to the service. For example WeatherUnderground will require IL/NAPERVILLE where the Input city for TheWeather.com would be 157281. Experimentation with search city names will be required.
*   A new Display City field will be used to provide a "pretty" output display.
* Upgraded Swift syntax to version 3 (still supports 10.9 and up)
* Switch weather source internal format from XML to json where possible
* Add TheWeather.com, WeatherUnderground, AerisWeather, and WorldWeatherOnline as data sources
*   WeatherUnderground is the recommended API for Weather.com
*   OpenWeatherMap now requires an API key
*   No change to Yahoo
*   Recommended weather sources are OpenWeatherMap,WeatherUnderground, AerisWeather, or Yahoo
*   All except for Yahoo require individual API keys for each service so users don't step on each other - See the preference pane for additional information
*   Yahoo is still squirrely but seems to be stable lately
*   TheWeather.com is forecast only, no current weather.
* Add mmHg option for barometric pressure
* Add option to rotate cities (on same schedule as weather refresh)
* Add option to limit forecast days
* Add option for startup delay to allow for computers using WiFi (default is 10 seconds - change to 0 for immediate launch)
* Correct a crash if the non-system font (default TAHOMA) was disabled or otherwise not available
