You can customize how that is displayed by using the Preferences pane. You can choose up to 7 additional weather locations to be monitored. Those cities will be displayed as a sub-menu that is displayed when you click on the primary weather display in the menubar.\n\nControls is runtime menu for Meteo.\n\n° You can quickly access the Preferences pane by clicking on the menu bar then pressing Command comma (⌘,).\n° You can force a reload of the current temps by clicking on the menu bar then pressing Command r (⌘R).\n° You can force force Meteo to Relaunch by clicking on the menu bar then pressing Command back-caret (⌘`). The back-cadet is usually found to the right of the 1 (one) key on the main keyboard.\n° You can force Meteo to Quit by clicking on menu bar then pressing Command Q (⌘Q).\n\nPreferences allow customization of Meteo.\n\nWith the Locations tab, you can provide up to 8 weather locations to monitor.\n\n° In the City Name/LocalityID column, enter either a City, State or a Latitude, Longitude. The requirement varies based on the Weather Source. Look at the details on the bottom of the preference pane. Pay special attention to comma’s and spaces. If you specify a location of <here>, the current location at the time Meteo was started will be used. Other than for obtaining your current weather, your location is not stored or used by Meteorologist.\n° In the Display Name column, this is the name as it will appear in the menu. If not provided, it will default to the City Name/LocalityID column.\n° In the Weather Source column, choose your desired weather source. Different weather sources work better for different locations.\n° In the API Key column, if your chosen Weather Source requires a key, enter it here. See the Key tab for details.\n° In the Key 2 Part 2 column, some Weather Source’s require 2 distinct keys. Provide the second key here.\n\nWith the Options tab you can select the various display options used by Meteorologist.\n\n° The Menu Font is the font used on the menu bar. The Display Font is the font used in the drop down display.\n° Launch Delay will cause Meteorologist to wait the requested number of seconds before attempting to look up the weather. This is useful when you are restarting your Mac and you are on a WiFi connection.\n° Log message to console will display additional (debug) message when running Meteorologist. You will probably only select this option when requested.\n° Global Units is used to change from Imperial to Metric or any combination.\n\nWith the Global Units tab you can select the units you want to be displayed.\n\n° Note - the units are internally stored in Imperial format. Some values may change slightly when converting to Metric.\n\nThe Keys tab described both where to get Keys (for the weather sources) and how to format the location for a given weather source. Not all weather sources require a license key.\n\n° The first column is where to sign up for an API Key. If you need your own account, you should click on the link to request an account. Once you have that account, use that information in the API Key fields.\n° The second part describes what City Name/location format is required by the selected Weather Source. Pay special attention to comma’s and spaces.\n\nThe Help tab displays this information.";
